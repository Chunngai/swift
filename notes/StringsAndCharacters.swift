Extended grapheme clusters can be composed of multiple Unicode scalars. 
This means that different characters‚Äîand different representations 
of the same character‚Äîcan require different amounts of memory to store. 
Because of this, characters in Swift don‚Äôt each take up the same amount of memory 
within a string‚Äôs representation. 
As a result, the number of characters in a string can‚Äôt be calculated 
without iterating through the string to determine its extended grapheme cluster boundaries. 
If you are working with particularly long string values, be aware that 
the count property must iterate over the Unicode scalars in the entire string 
in order to determine the characters for that string.
The count of the characters returned by the count property 
isn‚Äôt always the same as the length property of an NSString 
that contains the same characters. 
The length of an NSString is based on the number of 16-bit code units 
within the string‚Äôs UTF-16 representation 
and not the number of Unicode extended grapheme clusters within the string.

Like strings, each substring has a region of memory

or part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store another substring. 
(Strings have a similar optimization, but if two strings share memory, they are equal.) 
This performance optimization means 
you don‚Äôt have to pay the performance cost of copying memory 
until you modify either the string or substring. 
As mentioned above, substrings aren‚Äôt suitable for long-term storage‚Äî
because they reuse the storage of the original string, 
the entire original string must be kept in memory as long as any of its substrings are being used
