/*
Floating-point literals can be decimal (with no prefix), 
or hexadecimal (with a 0x prefix). 
They must always have a number (or hexadecimal number) on both sides 
of the decimal point. 

Decimal floats can also have an optional exponent, 
indicated by an uppercase or lowercase e; 
hexadecimal floats must have an exponent, 
indicated by an uppercase or lowercase p.

For hexadecimal numbers with an exponent of exp, 
the base number is multiplied by 2^exp:
0xFp2 means 15 x 22, or 60.0.
0xFp-2 means 15 x 2-2, or 3.75.

Numeric literals can contain extra formatting to make them easier to read. 
Both integers and floats can be padded with extra zeros 
and can contain underscores to help with readability. 
Neither type of formatting affects the underlying value of the literal
